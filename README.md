Install: <br >
nodejs<br >
npm (you probably have this already, check in terminal by running "npm -v")<br >
Visual Studio Code or another IDE that you prefer, this is my preferance for web dev<br >
ionic cli, go to the website and follow their steps<br >
now because a lot of us havent really used this before i suggest trying to make a dummy app to set things up 
https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/your-first-app this should be able to help a fair bit. <br >
We're going to be using the Angular framework, it works best with ionic.
